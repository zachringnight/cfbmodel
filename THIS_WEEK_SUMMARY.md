# Running the Model for This Week's Games - Summary

## What Was Done

I've implemented a complete solution for running the CFB model to predict this week's college football games. The system automatically detects the current week based on today's date (October 15, 2025 = Week 7 of the 2025 season).

## Files Created

### Main Implementation
1. **`run_weekly_predictions.py`** - Core script with automatic week detection
   - Automatically calculates current week from date
   - Supports training and prediction in one command
   - Provides detailed output with confidence scores
   - Visual confidence indicators (progress bars)

2. **`test_weekly_predictions.py`** - Demonstration script
   - Works without API key (uses synthetic data)
   - Shows complete workflow from training to prediction
   - Validates that everything is working correctly

### Convenience Scripts
3. **`run_this_week.py`** - Simplest way to run predictions
   - Just run: `python run_this_week.py`
   - Automatically uses current year and trains on previous year
   - Clear error messages if API key is missing

4. **`run_this_week.sh`** - Interactive bash script
   - Menu-driven interface
   - Options for training new model or using existing one

### Documentation
5. **`WEEKLY_PREDICTIONS_GUIDE.md`** - Complete user guide
   - Detailed instructions
   - Examples and troubleshooting
   - Advanced usage scenarios

## How to Use

### Method 1: Simplest (Recommended)
```bash
export CFB_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
python run_this_week.py
```

### Method 2: Test Without API Key
```bash
python test_weekly_predictions.py
```

### Method 3: Advanced Usage
```bash
python run_weekly_predictions.py --train --train-year 2024 --week 7
```

### Method 4: Interactive
```bash
./run_this_week.sh
```

## What Happens When You Run It

1. **Week Detection**: Automatically determines current week (Week 7 for Oct 15, 2025)
2. **Training** (if --train flag used): Trains model on previous season's data
3. **Data Fetching**: Gets games scheduled for the current week
4. **Feature Preparation**: Processes team statistics and talent ratings
5. **Predictions**: Generates predictions with confidence scores
6. **Output**: Displays results with visual confidence indicators

## Example Output

```
======================================================================
PREDICTIONS FOR WEEK 7 - 2025 SEASON
======================================================================

Game 1: Michigan State @ Michigan
  Date: 2025-10-18
  Predicted Winner: Michigan
  Confidence: ██████████████████████████████ 89.2%
  Probability: Home 89.2% | Away 10.8%

Game 2: Texas A&M @ Alabama
  Date: 2025-10-18
  Predicted Winner: Alabama
  Confidence: ████████████████████████░░░░░░ 76.5%
  Probability: Home 76.5% | Away 23.5%
```

## Week Calculation Logic

The system calculates the current week by:
- Finding the start of the CFB season (last Saturday of August)
- Counting weeks since the season started
- For October 15, 2025: Week 7

## Testing & Validation

✅ All existing unit tests pass (10/10)
✅ Week calculation verified for October 15, 2025 → Week 7
✅ Test script demonstrates full workflow without API key
✅ Integration with existing codebase confirmed

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Dependencies from requirements.txt (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, requests)
- College Football Data API key (get from https://collegefootballdata.com/)

## Next Steps for Users

1. **Get an API Key**: Sign up at https://collegefootballdata.com/
2. **Set Environment Variable**: `export CFB_API_KEY="your_key"`
3. **Run Predictions**: `python run_this_week.py`

Or test without API key: `python test_weekly_predictions.py`

## Integration Notes

- Works with existing model infrastructure
- Compatible with all existing scripts (main.py, example.py, demo.py)
- Uses same data_fetcher, preprocessor, and model classes
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Support
