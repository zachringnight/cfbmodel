# CFB Model - Operational Status Report

## ✅ Status: FULLY OPERATIONAL

The College Football Prediction Model has been made fully operational with the following enhancements:

## Changes Made

### 1. Executable Script (`main.py`)
- Added shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env python3`) for direct execution
- Made executable with proper permissions (`chmod +x`)
- Can now be run as: `./main.py --api-key KEY --year 2023 --train`

### 2. Package Support (`__init__.py`)
- Created package initialization file
- Exposes main classes: `CFBModel`, `CFBPreprocessor`, `CFBDataFetcher`
- Includes version info (`__version__ = "2.0.0"`)
- Enables `import cfbmodel` or `from cfbmodel import CFBModel`

### 3. Installable Package (`setup.py`)
- Created setuptools configuration
- Supports `pip install -e .` for development installation
- Creates `cfbmodel` console command
- Includes all dependencies from requirements.txt
- Proper metadata and classifiers

### 4. Updated Documentation (`README.md`)
- Added two installation options (direct and package)
- Updated usage examples to show all three execution methods
- Clear instructions for package installation

## Usage Methods

The model can now be used in three ways:

### Method 1: Direct Script Execution
```bash
./main.py --api-key YOUR_API_KEY --year 2023 --train
```

### Method 2: Python Module
```bash
python main.py --api-key YOUR_API_KEY --year 2023 --train
```

### Method 3: Installed Package Command
```bash
# First install
pip install -e .

# Then use
cfbmodel --api-key YOUR_API_KEY --year 2023 --train
```

## Verification Tests

All operational tests pass:

1. ✅ **Script Executable**: `main.py` has executable permissions and shebang
2. ✅ **Package Installed**: `cfbmodel` version 2.0.0 installed successfully
3. ✅ **Command Available**: `cfbmodel` command accessible at `~/.local/bin/cfbmodel`
4. ✅ **Unit Tests**: All 10 tests pass (100% success rate)
5. ✅ **Import Tests**: All modules import without errors
6. ✅ **Functional Tests**: Model trains, predicts, saves, and loads correctly

## Test Results

```
Test 1: Importing modules........................ ✓ PASS
Test 2: Initializing components................... ✓ PASS
Test 3: Training model with sample data........... ✓ PASS
Test 4: Making predictions........................ ✓ PASS
Test 5: Saving and loading model.................. ✓ PASS

Unit Tests: 10 passed in 2.65s.................... ✓ PASS
```

## Files Modified

- `main.py` - Added shebang, made executable
- `__init__.py` - Created (new file)
- `setup.py` - Created (new file)
- `README.md` - Updated with new installation/usage instructions

## Backward Compatibility

All changes are 100% backward compatible:
- Existing scripts using `python main.py` continue to work
- All existing imports continue to work
- All existing functionality preserved
- No breaking changes to API

## Next Steps

The model is now operational and ready for use. Users can:

1. Train models with historical data
2. Make predictions on upcoming games
3. Install as a package for easier deployment
4. Use in automated scripts or cron jobs
5. Import and use in other Python projects

## Conclusion

The CFB model is **FULLY OPERATIONAL** and ready for production use.
