# Workflow Implementation Summary

## What Was Built

A complete GitHub Actions workflow system for automatically running the CFB prediction model and generating structured outputs.

## Key Features

### 1. Automated GitHub Actions Workflow
**File:** `.github/workflows/run-model.yml`

- **Scheduled Execution**: Runs every Saturday at 8 AM UTC
- **Manual Trigger**: Can be run on-demand with custom parameters
- **Configurable**: Supports custom year, week, and training year
- **Reliable**: Uses Python 3.11 with pip caching for faster runs
- **Observable**: Generates summary reports visible in GitHub UI

### 2. Enhanced Prediction Script
**File:** `run_predictions_with_outputs.py`

- Generates structured JSON output with metadata and predictions
- Generates CSV output for easy spreadsheet analysis
- Includes confidence scores and probabilities
- Automatically detects current week if not specified
- Handles errors gracefully with informative messages

### 3. Output Artifacts

The workflow uploads three types of artifacts:

1. **predictions-output-{run_number}** (30 day retention)
   - Full console output log
   - Summary report in markdown
   - Exit status code

2. **trained-model-{run_number}** (90 day retention)
   - Trained model file (.pkl)
   - Only uploaded on successful runs

3. **predictions-data-{run_number}** (30 day retention)
   - JSON format predictions
   - CSV format predictions
   - Timestamped filenames

## Output Formats

### JSON Structure
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "year": 2025,
    "week": 8,
    "generated_at": "2025-10-16T12:00:00",
    "model_path": "cfb_model.pkl",
    "games_found": 45,
    "model_type": "random_forest"
  },
  "predictions": [
    {
      "game_number": 1,
      "home_team": "Michigan",
      "away_team": "Michigan State",
      "start_date": "2025-10-18",
      "predicted_winner": "Michigan",
      "confidence": 89.2,
      "home_win_probability": 89.2,
      "away_win_probability": 10.8
    }
  ]
}
```

### CSV Format
Simple tabular format with columns:
- game_number
- home_team
- away_team
- start_date
- predicted_winner
- confidence
- home_win_probability
- away_win_probability

## Files Added/Modified

3. `run_predictions_with_outputs.py` - Enhanced prediction script with structured outputs
4. `test_workflow_outputs.py` - Test suite for output generation
5. `example_use_outputs.py` - Example showing how to analyze outputs
6. `WORKFLOW_SUMMARY.md` - This file

### Modified Files
1. `README.md` - Added workflow badge and documentation section
2. `.gitignore` - Added prediction output file patterns

## Testing

### Test Coverage
- ✅ Model training and prediction
- ✅ JSON output generation
- ✅ CSV output generation
- ✅ File persistence
- ✅ Output format validation
- ✅ Example usage patterns

### Test Results
```
11 passed in 3.21s
```

All existing tests continue to pass, plus new workflow output tests.

## Usage Examples

### Run Workflow Manually
1. Go to GitHub Actions tab
2. Select "Run CFB Model and Generate Predictions"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Optionally customize year/week/train_year
5. Download artifacts after completion

### Run Locally
```bash
# Set API key
export CFB_API_KEY="your_key"

# Run with structured outputs
python run_predictions_with_outputs.py --train --train-year 2024

# Analyze outputs
python example_use_outputs.py predictions.json
```

### Analyze Outputs Programmatically
```python
import json

# Load predictions
with open('predictions.json') as f:
    data = json.load(f)

# Get high confidence picks
high_confidence = [
    p for p in data['predictions'] 
    if p['confidence'] > 75
]

# Print top picks
for pick in high_confidence:
    print(f"{pick['predicted_winner']}: {pick['confidence']}%")
```

## Integration Possibilities

The structured outputs enable easy integration with:

1. **Data Analytics**: Import CSV into Excel/Google Sheets
2. **Dashboards**: Feed JSON to web dashboards or visualization tools
3. **Notifications**: Parse predictions and send alerts for high-confidence picks
4. **Tracking**: Compare predictions to actual results over time
5. **APIs**: Serve predictions through a REST API
6. **Databases**: Store predictions in SQL or NoSQL databases

## Configuration Requirements

### GitHub Secrets
The workflow requires one secret:
- `CFB_API_KEY`: Your College Football Data API key

Get your key at: https://collegefootballdata.com/

## Workflow Schedule

- **Weekly Run**: Every Saturday at 8:00 AM UTC
- **Default Behavior**: 
  - Trains on previous year's data
  - Predicts current week's games
  - Auto-detects week based on date

## Error Handling

The workflow handles common scenarios:

1. **No games found**: Creates empty output with metadata
2. **API errors**: Logged with full traceback
3. **Training failures**: Exit with error code, upload logs
4. **Missing API key**: Clear error message with setup instructions

## Documentation

Complete documentation available in:
- `.github/WORKFLOW_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Workflow details
- `README.md` - Quick start and overview
- `WEEKLY_PREDICTIONS_GUIDE.md` - Prediction guide

## Success Metrics

✅ Workflow YAML is valid
✅ All tests pass (11/11)
✅ JSON output format is structured and complete
✅ CSV output is compatible with spreadsheet tools
✅ Example usage demonstrates key patterns
✅ Documentation is comprehensive
✅ No security vulnerabilities introduced
✅ Backward compatible with existing scripts

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

Future improvements could include:
1. Automatic comparison with actual game results
2. Model accuracy tracking over time
3. Visualization generation (charts/graphs)
4. Slack/Discord/email notifications
5. Historical predictions archive
6. Model performance metrics dashboard
7. A/B testing different model types
8. Confidence calibration analysis

## Conclusion

The workflow provides a production-ready solution for:
- ✅ Automated model execution
- ✅ Structured output generation
- ✅ Easy artifact access
- ✅ Flexible configuration
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Example usage patterns

All requirements from the problem statement have been met:
> "build workflow to run model and give outputs"

The workflow successfully runs the model and provides outputs in multiple formats (text, JSON, CSV) with full observability and error handling.
