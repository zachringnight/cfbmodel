## What Was Tested

### âœ… Core Functionality (All Working)
```
âœ“ Model initialization and configuration
âœ“ Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
âœ“ Model training (Random Forest & Gradient Boosting)
âœ“ Predictions with confidence scores
âœ“ Model save/load functionality
âœ“ Input validation and error handling
âœ“ API client initialization
```

### âœ… Three Execution Methods (All Working)
```bash
# Method 1: Direct script
./main.py --help              # âœ… Works

# Method 2: Python module  
python main.py --help         # âœ… Works

# Method 3: Installed package
pip install -e .              # âœ… Installs
cfbmodel --help               # âœ… Works
```
